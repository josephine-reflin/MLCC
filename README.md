Linear Regression Taxi Fare Prediction
This project is part of Googleâ€™s Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC) exercises.
It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a linear regression model to predict taxi fares in Chicago using historical trip data.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal is to:

Load and explore the Chicago Taxi Trips dataset.

Identify correlations between trip features and fare amount.

Build a simple linear regression model with Keras.

Experiment with different features and hyperparameters.

Evaluate model performance using RMSE and loss curves.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: City of Chicago Taxi Trips

Subset: Two-day period in May 2022

Key features:

TRIP_MILES â€” Distance of the trip

TRIP_SECONDS â€” Duration of the trip

TRIP_MINUTES â€” Derived from TRIP_SECONDS

FARE â€” Fare amount (label)

COMPANY â€” Taxi company

PAYMENT_TYPE â€” Payment method

TIP_RATE â€” Tip percentage

ðŸ›  Installation
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install google-ml-edu==0.1.3 keras~=3.8.0 matplotlib~=3.10.0 numpy~=2.0.0 pandas~=2.2.0 tensorflow~=2.18.0
ðŸš€ Usage
Run the notebook in Google Colab or locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook linear_regression_taxi.ipynb
Main steps in the notebook:

Load dataset

Explore dataset (summary stats, correlations, visualizations)

Train model with:

Single feature (TRIP_MILES)

Hyperparameter tuning

Two features (TRIP_MILES + TRIP_MINUTES)

Evaluate results using RMSE and plots.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Best RMSE (two features): ~3.48

Strongest correlation to fare: TRIP_MILES

Weakest correlation to fare: TIP_RATE

Using two features improved prediction accuracy compared to a single feature.
